							      *checkmark.nvim*

This plugin runs a test and puts checkmarks next to respective test cases.
Currently supports only golang, but will potentially be expanded to allow
other language implementations. See usage examples below:

To configure the plugin, use the .setup({opts}) approach:
							   *checkmark.setup()*
checkmark.setup({opts})
  Configure the plugin, using following options:
    {opts.command}:
        The command that is used to execute tests. Table of strings.

        Default value: { "go", "test", "-v", "-json", "./..." }

    {opts.log_lvl}:
        Log level for internal logger. Uses |plenary.log| module

						       *checkmark.run_tests()*
checkmark.run_tests()
  Runs tests for current file. In case of failed tests, the test output is
  added to |vim.diagnostic| list. Can be run from command mode 
  with <GoTestCheckmark>

						    *checkmark.test_on_save()*
checkmark.test_on_save()
  Attaches an event listener, whenever the current file (buffer) is saved,
  tests are re-run and checkmarks added where applicable. Can be run from
  command mode with <GoTestOnSave>
