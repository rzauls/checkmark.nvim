# checkmark.nvim

Adds checkmarks for successful tests in nvim virtual text

## TODO

- write a proper readme
- establish planned v1 feature set (checkmarks when running go tests on the test definitions)
- fix nested package test lookup
- ?maybe? add table driven test support (checkmark for each case, not just the root test function)
